# Sprint_Review_and_Retrospective

#How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

I interpret userneeds by making sure that I understand exaclty what the customer needs. I take notes and develop user stories to make sure that I take down what the customer wants. I make sure that my communication with with the product owner is very good to make sure i get the product right. 

#How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

When developing programs and take a step back and map out what is being asked of me. I take a lot of notes from the materials given to help to see how I am going to start my development. The one thing that I want to start doing is developing user stories to help and organize the information provided by the customer. 

#What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

To be a good team member in software development means a lot of things. One thing for sure is making your communication with the team be the best it can be. This will help to let everyone know what you are working on and gives you a chance to ask for help if needed. Being a good team member also means completing the tasks that you are working on so that the team progresses. Sometimes if something you do is not completed then someone else cannot do the next thing.
